# Tracing

Tracing -- rather Distributed tracing -- is the process of identifying the request flow from start to end, while along the way collecting some key metrics.  This is very useful for distributed applications in identifying various bottlenecks.
In particular, OpenTracing, being a CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation) project is the place to go to for more resources.
